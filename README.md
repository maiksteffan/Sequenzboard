# Sequenzboard Firmware Repository

Welcome! This repository contains the firmware development for the **Sequenzboard** ‚Äì an interactive, LED-guided training board inspired by climbing movement.  
This document outlines the system architecture, milestones, and expectations to help guide the firmware implementation process.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

Develop a modular, reliable firmware stack for the Sequenzboard that enables responsive training interactions, visual feedback, and remote updates.

---

## Overview

### 1. Helper Methods (Hardware Abstraction)
Provide foundational helper methods for implementing training program logic. These methods abstract the control of:

- **LED Strips** ‚Äì Visual Feedback (WS2812)
- **Touch Sensors** ‚Äì User Input (26 I¬≤C-capable custom PCBs)
- **Display** ‚Äì User Interface + Touch Input (LVGL-based)

These methods will form the backbone of the training program logic and allow for scalable implementation of training types.

---

### 2. Navigable UI
- Users can browse and select from different training modes
- Upon selection, the training starts automatically 

---

### 3. Training Programm Logic
The User can choose from The following Training-Modes: 
(The different Modes will be explained later)
- **Guided Workouts**
- **High Score Challenge modes**
- **Multiplayer Game**
  
Those Modes will use similar Methods from the controller classes but orchestrate them differntly. 
Once a training session is running, real-time interaction between the following components is orchestrated:
- LED strips ‚Üí visual instruction & feedback  
- Touch sensors ‚Üí user input  
- Display ‚Üí progress indication + additional input

**Important: The different interactions shouldn't block each other. 
For example, while listening to touch inputs from the grips, the user should still be able to use the touchdisplay**

---

### 4. Remote Updates

The system must support **OTA (Over-the-Air)** updates, allowing firmware, content, and UI enhancements to be remotely delivered.
